## DAY 1: 
-----------------------------------
1:10
Silence please! Hey Red shirt! You came 10 minutes late! Can you not go without stamping legs?
Dayacēsi niśśabdhaṅgā uṇḍaṇḍi! Hē reḍ ṣarṭ! Mīru 10 nimiṣālu ālasyaṅgā vaccāru! Kāḷlu tokkakuṇḍā veḷlalēmā?
hey babu silence silence,  

1:16
Fool, show him his seat please! Are you not satisfied with gossip? Show is about to begin.
1:21
Begin the show! You would have come to watch this film with your family or friends,
1:27
Could you smile at an unknown person sitting next to you? Not only in this 180 minutes of film,
1:33
If perfect strangers meeting on road can smile at each other like humans, society would be wonderful!
1:42
Families are the foundations for such healthy society. The corner stone!
3:39
Everyone cannot do everything fine. Seetha would do this excellently. Looks like she has not yet got up.
3:45
Shall I wake her up? You wait for an opportunity to while away time in gossip.
3:51
I will do it myself.
3:56
Get up dear! Get up Get up! You woke up every day well before me.
4:03
What happened to you today? Then, I will put the design in courtyard. Later do not lament aunt is design is much better than mine.
4:11
I am calling you, get up! Why are you so lazy? Get up! Get up I say!
4:20
When did you get ready? When means...long back! Home must have a girl like you, heart will be peaceful.
4:28
Then, I am late! Did Babu bring milk?
4:36
I forgot! Mother earth! Every step I put on you, take it as kiss instead of step.
4:48
Grandma!
4:55
Be careful! - Okay.
5:01
Be careful! It must not be there! It is there! - Why? If we it must not be there, it will be there or vice versa.
5:09
You know that? Do not know, I know everything just like that!
5:14
This jasmine plant was planted by my mother-in-law when I was very young. Do not know at what auspicious time she planted it,
5:21
it keeps on blooming! One must do something good in life before going away!
5:26
Ask her what did she do? I have given my son as her husband. What else she wants?
5:37
Give it to me, I will take it to home. Okay sir. Bye sir. - Okay.
5:48
Greetings sir. - Where are you coming from early morning? Had work near temple, going home after finishing it. We are going to farm. - Okay.
5:57
Are you doing fine?
6:13
Why are you ignoring me? Are you doing fine? Okay, go.
6:42
She is his sister is daughter! She knows what people want and what they think!
6:51
Sari is good! - Very good! Where is your aunt?
7:05
God! The difficulties which we can overcome, protect us from getting arrogant!
7:13
What? Look there, Lord Rama and Seetha! Here we both! Difficulties?
7:19
Did you see or not, Rama is not putting his hand on Seetha.
7:24
Keep laughing, we spent 30 years together with this laugh, not much long time? What happened? - What should happen?
7:31
If children settle in time and marry, If this home is happy with grandchildren, how nice it would be!
7:38
The elder one cannot stand a remark! The younger one talks his way out from everything. Do not know how... - Leave it.
7:44
If there is anything, they will take care of it themselves. They must, If not they who else would?
7:58
Like a sky is falling upon... like an unexpected disaster is befalling...
8:05
Few bother, what next? Some say be smart to find opportunities to overcome hurdles to stay ahead...
8:16
Think of something and something else happening... Accepting it as fate is philosophy...
8:25
Keep searching for something, ask for everything... Creating scene saying no one would do it...
8:34
What shall we do? What can we do even If we think? What shall we foresee?
8:41
There is unknown void before us... What shall we say? Who asked us? What is there to say anyway?
9:36
Follow...the world... Say...what the world says...
9:45
Trouble inside... Dare take on me...
9:54
Do not ask which way to go, bro... How to tell this is the right way?




## DAY 2:
-----------------------------------
10:02
People know this... No use in making vain tries... It is difficult to face the heat...
10:59
We do many things... We madly run after unknown...
11:08
We bother ourselves a lot... We say this is life...
11:17
This journey of confusion is going for eons... Life is movement forward without looking back...
11:25
Life is a mystery, do not ask about that... Not knowing it is unknown difficulty...
11:32
No use in asking or getting angry...
12:03
What is good about? Life is just going wrong way! To hell with your good morning.
12:15
First time I am seeing some hitting a computer so strongly. Not even smiles!
12:20
Why are you with long faces? Making your own plans inside. What happened? - Did you not see it down?
12:26
Englishmen have said it in English, everyone is getting fired! Why are you telling him?
12:31
I do not know about others but he is sure to escape! Boss is his uncle! Sir, uncle is calling you.
12:39
I will check If it is true or not.
12:48
Why should we get tensed and waste our time on this, sir? What we chiefly need is this!
12:53
Are you telling me indirectly to shut the TV and mind my work?
13:02
Come in. - He is inside already. Your boy appears dull but he is very tough.
13:10
Sit down. How long can you depend on contract jobs?
13:17
You should have found another job by now. Are you keeping or firing me? That is the problem with you.
13:23
You may think though I know you well but did not help you. Must not let others tell you. You must be fast!
13:30
Tell me if there is anything new, I am already irritated! That is your... - Look at my face and say that!
13:37
I am telling it on your face! Boys of 23 or 24 years are earning a lakh every month.
13:42
Did you ever compare with them and thought about your position? You do not do that but get angry!
13:49
I have been seeing you for 6 years, did you ever say good morning to anyone here? You do not know to be smart! Do not know how to live!
13:55
Just like you your father too was straightforward and lost his property. Moreover glosses it as goodness.
14:02
When times are hard, we have to bow! Look, we do not have anything left even to sell!
14:08
What is wrong if I am like this? I will be like myself. Worries about not saying good morning.
14:14
Worry If I did not greet you, do not worry about others. Would people take money with them?
14:20
Many people have left this place, there is no one here to count. To hell with your job!
14:28
3 years have passed since we arrived here. Would have faced 30 interviews. Why software jobs have become so tough?
14:35
Give it to me, junior! Cannot even smoke a cigarette peacefully. Smoke and kill yourself, go!
14:43
Where did she get her waist done? It is so thin!
14:50
You look handsome and innocent. But nasty comments! One can judge a man by his dirty friends!
14:59
What is this buddy? You pass the comment and we get chided! Had it been in our Vijayawada? Do you know the reaction?
15:05
I am also from Vijayawada, my home is in Benz circle! Buddy, you deal with her. When you are sixty,
15:11
you must have memories that people used to pass comments, If possible encourage people to be active
15:17
Do not make them lazy compulsorily. Go to college, you are getting late.
15:23
She was fine but turned into a devil after seeing you. If one in home settles, others can manage it.
15:31
There is nothing like small or big in jobs, do whatever you get! My dad has minted money but insists on making your own money.
15:37
I do not get him. What? What is up, bro?
15:43
I can hear you, go ahead. I... - You...? I left the job.
15:48
Good! He is up to it again.
15:55
Did you find another one? I will think about that later, for now I quit the job.
16:00
You take decisions quickly. I can never do like that. My foot! There is a limit for everything.
16:06
Would I remain like this forever? You are right, if we hit must hit the jackpot! Do not struggle for few thousands. Go back home! I am here.
16:16
Did you tell dad about this? I am not telling anyone, I have told you, that is it. I am packing off from here.
16:23
What else? - What else, bro?
16:29
Tell me. - Okay bye. Okay.
16:43
There is a limit for everything, is it there?
16:49
Would it remain like that forever?
16:56
Common man, do not live a nondescript life among 700 crores...
17:07
What is there on the other side that you run towards a mythical future?
17:21
He is Kondal Rao is son! Does he not have a name? People call him as Goodu Raju!
17:27
By the way who is Kondal Rao? What is cooking in your home today? He wants the world to know it is fish today in his home.
17:35
By the way, are they good or bad people? Even God is not bothered about it. Why should we bother? Let us see, what is their trouble?
17:56
Are you playing cards? Who got the joker? Nobody got it?
18:02
How can anyone get? The joker is with me.
18:07
Useless Jilebis, Why do you not eat Kajjikayalu? Mind your business, man! You said you are going to Dubai, Did you not go or did they not allow you?
18:14
There is no better country than India to live. We can sneeze, spit or sleep wherever we feel like.
18:20
Anyone who rubs against you would perish, If not he will perish because he rubbed against you.
18:25
He is a tricky man! - Am I? He is my brother-in-law, right? Making fun of me.
18:33
Are you doing fine? - Fine sir. Look at him! How beautifully he is coming with a smile! That smile can change the mind of a man committing suicide.
18:41
Do not praise him always, do some work to make this country rich. Can you or your son ever smile and be friendly like him?
18:47
If my son had been good, why would I comment about others? I would have got Seetha married to him. Shut up! Are you eying Seetha too?
18:56
Let anyone may have any idea, Seetha is for his elder son! Though she lost her parents as child,
19:02
they brought her up with love and care. It will happen, that is it. You are thinking from her mother is side,
19:08
What about her father is side? Those Vijayawada people, they are not in talking terms with them. Moreover they consider these people as poor. Is that not enough? It will not happen.
19:17
Brother! You have stopped talking to me!
19:23
How swiftly he changed the colour? Did I change? I am so close to him! Madam, looks like the elder one has come back with his entire luggage.
19:32
He leaves money in pockets, check before washing.
19:37
Recently I found a lakh and gave it as dowry for my daughter. You will give a lakh or two!
19:45
She never wears the same sari again, she is doing much better. Get them married, their wives will take care of them.
19:53
Did we say no to them? Their sister is studying in Anakapalli.
19:58
After studies she will get married first. Then, elder one will marry immediately. Younger one will marry on the same evening.
20:04
No need to search a girl for elder one, Seetha will make perfect match for him. No, I will not marry him. Never, he always calls me hey!
20:13
Did he ever call me by my name? Let him to call me Seetha, I will marry him next moment.
20:30
What? Hey you! What?
20:38
Flowers in tresses, sari... you look like Goddess Poleramma. Go away!
20:48
Do you know this, uncle? He has left the job again. How do you know that? Do not know, I know everything just like that!
20:57
Seetha, you too come and listen this. Last night Goddess Lakshmi appeared in my dream,
21:03
she presented a gold and silver vessel to our sons, and said all our problems are over!
21:11
True! - Okay... Nothing short in this laugh!
21:25
Looks like elder one is leaving early. Hey son! I have made coffee for you.
21:35
Where is he? Where did he go? He has gone to office. - So early?
21:44
Park it here, good place. It seems you passed comments on brother. Leave my shirt. - We too are unemployed.
21:49
We too are unemployed. What is going on there? You got saved because brother is here, I will take you to task later.
21:57
Nothing brother, Goodu Raju and his sidekicks. Cannot bear to see their overacting!
22:02
Do not get so excited! What is this? Is it nice? Do you have any sense?
22:07
What are you doing in a school? Though you have no work, did you not find any other game to play? Go...clear out.
22:14
I will call police, you will get the stick. Will you call police?
22:21
Crows are crowing over there, have you complained against it? Goods train is rattling out there, did you lodge complaint against it?
22:31
Are we the only gang here? Clear out everyone, we will also go.
22:36
Clear them... clear them... - Should have been born as drama artiste. Raju, elder one is here.
22:42
Neither he plays nor allows us to play. He always spoils the fun.
22:47
When did he come? - What bothers you man? Watch out, I will give him a shock. - What bothers you man?
22:55
Stay away from him! - Watch out boys! You will get kicked! Brother, that idiot is coming here.
23:07
Are you back from Vizag? Did you come back or did they send you out?
23:17
Jobs are suitable for you, marry and start playing cards here. We too would get another hand.
23:23
Hey... If I get a job with 1 lakh salary, can you or your father digest it?
23:29
Will you not be jealous? If I beat, you will start crying, fool! Go away!
23:34
First set your body right, tell him the address. I know it. - Go.
23:41
Something around should happen, If not people would observe us.
23:49
Hey boy! This is what you call going up in life! Stop that, we have reached, get up.
24:03
I have been watching you for a week. You have a face which anyone would like to see again and again.
24:11
There is a woman behind every successful man, I do not mind if you are not successful,
24:17
I will be there behind you! Alexander, Bill Gates... though they were great men,
24:23
they would have begged for a kiss from their wives!
24:28
So silly, right? That is why I am proposing. What do you say?
24:37
Indian women!
24:42
Stopped making plaits, right? Where will you keep flowers? How would you know about a kiss without a flower?
24:49
Oh God! All my feelings are dead! Hello Einstein, find a new version and send down!
24:56
Go...buy...out with bags! This is the Vijayawada family Kondal Rao mentioned about!
25:04
The new version of the younger one. Why are you still in bed?
25:10
Still sleeping? It is already 11 pm! Why are you still sleeping, bunking school? Get up!
25:18
Why are you so lazy? Girls must not sleep for so long, get up. I like only two things,
25:26
one is good sleep and another is good husband. Good, anyway your sister is marriage is fixed,
25:32
Let us find a good boy in the marriage and fix your marriage too. I know the man I want.
25:41
Get up!
26:01
Will he be six feet tall? Would he tie the knot with me? Would he give whatever I ask?
26:10
Would he bait me? Would he tease me? Would he impress everyone?
26:19
Why do you not stand properly? Do not feel embarrassed...
26:27
Do not just walk away without answering us...
27:13
He must carry me whenever I wish without any delay... Praising my beauty must become his habit...
27:22
What would I ask for more If he shares all my work?
27:32
Sensing my anger he must at once be modest with me... He must be determined to fulfill my wish...
27:41
My youth is eagerly waiting to see him...
27:50
When would he join me?
28:17
You must believe I am here. If you do not, since you are seeing me, you have to believe.
28:23
Oh Vizag family too is here! You talk very well but did not make it to the engagement ceremony.
28:29
That is... - No work! He goes around busy creating trouble like Narada.
28:35
It is true, if not since you said, it will be true. You will say this very well. - Take sweets.
28:41
How is Seetha? - Seetha is fine, Since she is Seetha, she will be fine, that is all!
28:49
Seetha too is very active like this, she is your cousin, right? Would you like to taste the sweet? She should have grown differently.
28:55
We must give her share of property and find a suitable boy for her.
29:01
I wish to spend my last days with her. But the old man wants to marry off Seetha to his elder son.
29:07
He is roaming without a job. I am worried he may get Seetha married to him, I am unable to do anything.
29:13
They will never change. Do not know how to live! When we do not have time to count money,
29:21
How can we spend time thinking about good and bad? Scams worth lakhs of crores are common today,
29:29
Should we bother about that or their anger and pride? The days are not the same, it has changed.
29:34
One must have a vision that is why they are there and we are here. I told my brother not to marry her, he did not listen,
29:42
Seetha was born and killed her parents. Can I tell a thing? Never spend too much time with unlucky people.
29:50
The less you talk about them the better. Will you not invite brother to the marriage?
29:57
What is that? Invitation. Take one! - Okay.
30:12
Slowly...slowly...
30:26
Whose marriage invitation is this? It looks very expensive! How much it would be...
30:33
You know whose invitation is this, you want aunt to hear this, right?
30:38
What is going on there? Do I not know that? Wealthy people will spend like that! Rich will go to any extent!
30:44
Neo rich! Would we go if they send the invitation with someone? You are sad because they are getting married but not your son, right aunt?
30:54
Did I tell you that? Do not know, I know everything just like that! What do you know?
31:01
Your parents died when you were just 3 months, Though you were his brothers daughter, they left you here with us.
31:06
When we went to them for Chinnis college seat, It seems they made my elder son wait outside for 4 hours.
31:13
How bad he felt! They always behaved like this. They never respected us like humans.
31:19
If we do go there, they are worried about saris and jewels. Who wants all that?
31:25
Elder one! He is home, play your drama with him.
31:34
Are you here only? Must go to Vijayawada marriage. Whose marriage? - Our relatives.
31:45
We will not go. - No, my son...listen to me. I have to go to Vizag, must bring back your sister.
31:50
Anyway, they are not strangers, right? Our relatives, many others would come there. Son!
31:56
You know I will not go, why do you insist me to go? I will not go, they act too much!
32:01
They are not in our relatives list. Well, striking off from list! Tiffs are nothing, only human is count.
32:08
Uncle! If we attend any marriage, tell us if there is any marriage where they will not ask what are you doing?
32:14
We both would go!
32:23
I will not go! Did you see? He is my eldest son, that is why he refused to go.
32:29
We both are same! - Come here. Younger is there, right? Let is send him.
32:34
Send him, he is the right person for that gang!
32:53
Please!
32:58
Once more please! What? I wanted to see you again!
33:06
Good omen!
33:31
They are no ordinary people! They are a big gang!
33:40
Would also go for such a marriage only?
33:46
Everyone is busy, let us have dinner, that will complete our job here. Would you like to join?
33:58
When did you come? Come. - No problem. Do not hesitate, come.
34:04
Did your parents not come? They will not! They are very sensitive people. Thank God, you made it.
34:11
Did I not tell about number son-in-law? If he marries anyone of your girls?
34:17
That is him! I saw him just now.
34:35
Please sit down? Where are you? Hyderabad?
34:41
What is your brother doing? Did you recognize me? Your grandma and I used to play a lot as little girls.
34:49
Whatever it is, you did not get your mother is beauty.
34:56
Will you just talk to him? Someone please take him to dinner. I will take him.
35:02
Sit down! Will we not do it, if we get the chance? Seniors get the chance. You take him.- Okay.
35:08
Please.
35:24
I am doing B.Tech in Narasapuram.
35:30
I am little caste conscious. I am maintaining a group too.
35:36
Can I tell you a thing? Girls have fallen flat for you. You too know that! But you are behaving as If you do not know...
35:42
If you are here for a minute more, I do not know where I would kiss you.
35:48
I am tempted! Stop it! Can have but not so much proud!
35:53
Stop it! Boys should have it. You cannot handle him, Queen Victoria must enter the arena.
35:59
Give me way and wish me all the best.
36:10
Give me a cigarette.
36:18
Who will give match box?
36:40
I am Geetha. Who asked you? Smoking cigarette to show manliness before girls.
36:49
Coward people and coward world, cigarette is for courage. You speak very well.
36:57
Hey Padal Sathi! - Who is he? A man like me! He would be there somewhere.
37:03
When a girl is talking to him, though nervous he tries to look calm.
37:11
Why should we talk about him? Tell me as a boy what did you feel on seeing me?
37:21
Tell me. You can go.
37:28
Do you want to hug or kiss? Were you expecting it? - I did not! No way!
37:36
You could have lied that you felt like that, I would have fallen for you.
37:54
Sister! Aunt is calling you. Calling you! - Go, she may bite you!
38:06
To control oneself on seeing the right kind of girl, Not just one, you have to read hundred Bhagavad Gitas!
38:28
You forgot your cell phone. I forgot it wantonly. You could have told me that.
38:36
Last night I could not sleep at all, you know that! - Why? Spent night watching you.
38:42
Do not know why time is so good on me! Any girl is falling for me in just 2 minutes.
38:48
I have seen only her left profile, let me see her right profile too.
38:58
Right is better! He has started it again!
39:05
We met just now, you do not have any fear of people watching us. Do you have cell phone? - Daddy number, I do not have.
39:14
Tell him to use as soap, what would he do with it? He must give it to you.
39:20
Go left and then right. What happened? - Cannot tell, my brother is here.
39:25
I saw her somewhere but I do not remember. Shut up, you saw here and tried to impress her.
39:31
You are too smart, you catch it easily. Okay come. - Nothing short in talking.
39:38
Is our entire group still doing nothing? When we were busy? - Where are they now? Waiting outside!
39:46
Tell them to stay outside only. Mother! - Wait there, do not come in.
39:53
I told you to wait there. I have told you not to go out together. People would cast evil eyes on you.
39:59
There is nothing like evil eyes. It must be warded off outside but you walked in. Let me do it, may all the evil eyes cast on you be warded off!
40:08
Enough! Let is spit! - You do it. Wash your legs, sons!
40:14
Hey fat woman! He is here. - Where would I go?
40:20
Leave me. You have grown thin, are you not eating? Worrying about you.
40:25
You are not a fat woman but dangerous woman. I will bite you! Look at him!
40:31
Forget about him, tell me about yourself. He will not leave her.
40:41
Offering of Annavaram is so good that you feel like licking the leaf too.
40:52
This is our coach, come. Give it to me, dear. - Uncle! How come you are here?
40:57
He is uncle from Relangi I told you about. I am very happy to meet you all though I did not attend your marriage.
41:05
I am happy for her getting such good parents-in-law, for you getting such a good daughter-in-law, and for meeting so many good people in one place!
41:15
Uncle says everybody is good because he is the best among good!
41:24
Did you see the girl? She is very good.
41:36
Look at the old woman, how well she is singing!
41:41
You too are there, eating and putting on weight. You too must sing like her from now.
41:46
Only that talent I lack. I am sitting silently. Both of teach me to sing. Both are unemployed, right?
41:52
Does she really mean it? - You both sing together! Your coffee, younger one!
42:00
Will it come if you clap? Get up and take it. Watch out, it will come.
42:06
He will not have till I give it to him, take my life like this every day.
42:12
Both are specimens! You are having your say! I was wearing twelve bangles in each hand
42:20
Your grandpa sold off everything. I thought you would buy it for me, but one watches TV and another keeps swinging.
42:27
I will kill you and throw a feast of your favorite dish to the town. I love Pulasa fish! You have to sell your property to throw a feast with it.
42:34
You are getting smart, I will bite you! Wait, wait...
42:45
Any problem? Can you not speak in Telugu? How many people live in the house? - Why?
42:51
Census! How many people have you counted till now? Joined duty 3 days ago, just now started the work.
42:58
Do not worry! Can you see that fat woman? - Fat woman! Shut up! I can call her,
43:03
If she hears you saying that she will crush your fingers between the door. She-devil! Tell me quickly, I will go away.
43:09
Father, mother, my sister, me and my brother! Total six! Six members!
43:14
Six is my lucky number. Give me your hand, sir. - Who would get benefitted? Go!
43:24
How many people are in this family? How could I forget her? - How many are there in the house? Where is he? Did he go away?
43:30
Tell me, how many people are there in the house? He will be here only, I will call him back. Forget about him, how could you forget about me? I did forget you wantonly.
43:36
See, you have forgotten me wantonly. You always do it. - Would I do it wantonly? Do not know, I know everything just like that!
43:42
Nobody considers me as a member of the family. What is this trouble? - You too do not consider me as family.
43:47
What is this? - What is this trouble? Done! - What done?
43:52
You never keep quiet, you always bring trouble.
43:59
Why are you crying dear? Nobody considers me as a member of the family, they did not even add my name in census.
44:05
Who? - Who else?
44:11
Elder one or younger one? - I do not have anyone. Why are you crying? Come with me.
44:17
Look at yourself while crying! I will not see!
44:23
Did you ever behave like you do not belong to this family? Did you hear her? To tell the truth, in fact everyone comes after you! Okay?
44:32
I will not see! - Look how you appear! Do not be so dejected...
44:40
Do not worry...do not get tensed... When you cry, gloom and sadness take you...
44:48
Do not make a long face... Do you have to cry so much to wet the world around you?
44:59
Do you have to be sullen to make even mirror afraid of seeing you?
45:09
Can cries relieve you of your worries? Why cry then?
45:17
Can tears bring back the joy? Why make useless endeavor?
45:50
Can we punish the hot summer? Can we curse the rains? Can we chase away chill winters?
45:58
Do we react angrily or shed tears? Do we not take it in our stride as it comes...
46:07
Why are you stubborn not to walk with others?
46:14
What would you gain by fighting others day in and day out?
47:08
Do you have to sweat it out? To bring a smile on your lips...
47:16
Do you have to move mountains or stop seas to bring cheer in life?
47:25
We have to prove we are humans... a season of sharing love...
47:33
Doors to the hearts... a never withering flower is smile...
48:14
Daddy, please sit for a moment. - What is it, dear? I want to tell an important matter, daddy.
48:21
My in-laws have a good proposal for Relangi uncle is daughter.
48:26
We met her while coming back from Annavaram. Very good proposal, I will get busy to leave to US.
48:32
That is why I am telling you to handle it. Please take them personally. Okay? One more thing. Do not tell them suddenly.
48:38
Tell grandma, she will manage. Your people are great! Why do they rush for with proposals?
48:46
Moreover for that Relangi people! People would laugh at us! Sleeping at night with a hope that tomorrow would be good,
48:54
but fear takes over morning about how life would go? They get kicked between hope and fear,
48:59
they keep kicked all the 365 days, We are not one who get kicked but people who kick!
49:04
That is the difference between us. Do not worry about them, be happy. Daddy, you cover up your jealousy very well.
49:13
Why is he behaving like this, mother? What are we doing? Just a help. She is just like me. Do what so ever you can, okay?
49:22
Is he one to get kicked or kick? Do you know this?
49:28
If you get 3 aces, you get loans in Bangkok. I am not playing. - What happened to you?
49:34
I want to go to loo. - Do you not want to use rest room?
49:39
Look there, you would feel like using it.
49:56
Hey you, come here! Why are you sitting without running away?
50:02
Why? We are not with them, sir. Though you are not with them, If I book you instead of them,
50:09
what would you call it? We will call it as you do not know anything.
50:16
Why are you beating him, sir? What is your father is name? What is your father is name? - Suryanarayana.
50:23
Suryanarayana? Will you not get up?
50:30
If you are so free, then what would they be doing? What is your father is name? What does he do?
50:38
What is your father is name? What is his name?
50:50
If I have done wrong, send me to jail for 14 years, I will accept it. You too have a father, right?
50:56
You expect others to respect him, right? Do you not know that?
51:07
Brother! It seems your elder son beat the Sub Inspector! - Why did he beat him?
51:14
He said something about father and he slapped him. - What?
51:20
It seems he slapped for saying something on father. You go. Slapped for father!
51:29
Why are you seeing my cards? - Unable to see your face. Play! - He is here!
51:38
When did he come? - Did my brother come here? I saw him at center.
51:46
She is trying a lot! Yes, Surekha! - Surekha? Who is she?
51:51
Some girl! I am sure she would be there somewhere. Feeling jealousy like you. Jealousy? Me? No way!
51:59
You could have lied saying yes, I would have given my life to you. He is talking to someone.
52:06
Do you know this? There are six boys chasing me in my street. Tasteless idiots!
52:14
Tell them that they would end up as Yogi Vemana. May I tell you shocking news? This too is jealousy!
52:22
She is smart too! Which one? - This one.
52:27
Shout near his ear. - He will break my teeth. Do it yourself. Fools! I will laugh out loud, you too join me. - Okay.
52:37
Children may die. - Laugh! My grandmother too would have done the same with my grandpa.
52:43
My great grandmother too would have done the same with my great grandfather.
52:49
Basically you like boys, to tell openly, you desire them madly. The good days are here for you to ask directly and take it directly.
52:58
These are the words that flattered me. No doubt, you were designed to do this. Will you please cut the call? - It is sin to cut it.
53:09
Boys take it as heroism to cut the call. Did he cut the call?
53:18
You invited trouble unnecessarily and he is coming here. Let him come, you all are with me, I am not scared.
53:24
He is going for his bike not coming to us. He is leaving home, do not invite trouble from him.
53:29
Was it your girlfriend? Good! Your brother has one at home and you have one in phone!
53:39
Why should we be afraid? - Silly idiot! Your shoulders have grown but not your brain.
53:45
Idiot! You are grown like a bull, tell him boys! He has become a big nuisance to the place.
53:51
Do not teach us, first teach your brother! Teach him first to run fast!
53:58
I have never seen him running away till now!
54:04
Will you giggling jeeringly? Can you rip coconuts with teeth?
54:12
Why are you beating him? Beat him!
54:19
I do not mind if he beats him, ensure he does not beat me. Run fast, he is catching up.
54:33
Did he join you or you joined him? Useless fellow, he does not have that much. Why are you with him then? - Just for fun... Just for fun?
54:39
Raju, let is play a game! - To hell with your game! Run!
54:50
Why did you stop running? Run! You were after him, why should I run?
54:57
He is an idiot! Bloody fool! Eat fruits!
55:03
I am going to Bhimavaram.
55:26
Which side is east? - East? Why? That side! Is it east whichever side you go?
55:34
Who is he? A man just like me, I am sure he would be there somewhere. He beats up fools like you!
55:41
Stand erect!
55:55
Eat...eat...no...no...
56:00
Eat! What is that?
56:06
Am I wrong if ant does not eat? - Go away!
56:28
Serve him few more pieces, perfect combination for soup.
56:35
Elder one, your sister has got a good proposal.
56:40
Dasireddy family, they used to live here long back. They made big money.
56:47
It seems they too have two sons just like you both. Both stand by one word.
56:53
Who brought the proposal?
57:02
Mother... Mother...
57:08
Serve food. Why do you not freshen up? You roam outside.
57:14
I will kill and eat you! Fat woman! Come fast!
57:22
First listen to me, your sister has got a good proposal. What does he do? - It is...I am unable to tell.
57:30
But they are a good family. What did father say? - What will he say? He too is a good man.
57:35
You have grown tall, you both must suggest good and bad. Who brought this proposal?
57:43
That is... Vijayawada family!
57:51
Gone! - Say no to them! Tell them we are not interested. Though we do not have property, we will find some man.
57:58
It seems they brought the proposal and you are telling us. Can we not find another groom in this world?
58:05
You must listen to her, right? I heard her, right?
58:11
Look, I do not like it. If you like it, you can go ahead. How can there be two opinions? We stand together, right?
58:16
Then, stand by me!
58:22
Building relationships is not as easy as beating a police man.
58:31
Should he not sit and talk, mother? Do we not get angry? If this is the result for broaching it,
58:40
I would say good bye to the proposal and Vijayawada family. You old woman! You started this.
58:48
Unable to tell people, sir.
59:00
If he is unable to tell, something must be troubling him. How can he say there?
59:07
Father! I am going to Hyderabad. - Anything urgent? No. I have to go, right? - Stay here for few days.
59:17
Okay, go. - Bye father. Is elder one coming to drop you? - He is coming. Is he coming or shall I come? - No need.
59:24
I will come if you want. He is coming, father.
1:01:09
I think it is better to go up! - Let it go.
1:01:24
Look at the crowd! Can they not stay at home, all are out to travel!
1:01:29
Everyone is busy!
1:01:37
Is not S2 our bogie? - No, it is S3, come. Go...why are you staring at them?
1:01:45
It is always great to come and leave. Hit...we must hit big time.
1:01:50
Do you have money? - I have. Look at my face and say that. - I do have. Do you? You will not have. Keep this!
1:01:57
I do have money!
1:02:04
Get in! Train is leaving, walk faster! - You are making me run here and there.
1:02:16
Call me after reaching there.
1:02:39
I have been seeing their act! Train must hit them!
1:02:44
Saying bye so much!
1:02:49
He said that for fun, It will not happen!
1:03:01
What is this? - I do not feel like going!
1:03:09
Okay come....come.
1:03:21
Father! Who is it? - Who is it? There is no one here who will not tell about him if you ask.
1:03:26
I will take you to him personally. No need, come let us take them. - Come.
1:03:32
On that bike? No way! Sit properly. You follow me.
1:03:37
Strange place! Asked about one man and so many are ready to guide us. Brother!
1:03:43
Brother, marriage party is here.
1:03:50
Did you recognize me? Kinsman of your Vijayawada brother-in-law. Oh you? How do you do? Please do not mistake us for coming to see the bride without intimation.
1:04:04
They did not even tell about coming, they have dropped in suddenly. Luck is always like that!
1:04:09
Do not exert yourself in excitement. She does it and is advising me.
1:04:30
Are they good people, elder one?
1:04:45
Are they good people, younger one? Super!
1:04:55
When everyone has said yes, who cares about my opinion?
1:05:02
Ask anything if you want. Did you see black and white film Thodikodallu? Because there would be two in home along with you.
1:05:12
You have seen film Gundamma Katha, right? They are like those two brothers! She is their sister, you need not have to worry about anything.
1:05:19
Fix it!
1:05:30
Offering...offering... You can gossip later, accept the offering.
1:05:40
Will you make me stand an hour for offering? Who do you think I am? I am MLA of this constituency.
1:05:47
Is this the way you respect an MLA? Call your EO. How dare you make an MLA stand here for an hour!
1:05:53
Please do not take it serious, heavy influx of devotees. Please come with me, sir. Go...go...take offering.
1:06:13
Why are you smiling at me? Do you know me? Do I know you? Did you ever see me?
1:06:18
Just now I saw you arguing with them. Instead of ignoring it,
1:06:24
I thought it is better to smile, that is all.
1:06:29
Would we get angry without any reason? - No... You would have crossed many bridges and difficulties to reach this position.
1:06:36
Is it possible for everyone to reach a position of ruling over people? I hate this system!
1:06:43
Why should we bother about system, sir? Newspaper write about so many things happening around,
1:06:50
We are common people who pray God we must not get caught in that. If we have time, we will visit temple If not we will pray from home.
1:06:58
Accept the offering. Please, sir. Which place are you from? - Quite a far place, sir.
1:07:06
My daughter is marriage invitation. I am here to keep it at the feet of lord. Do not know why whenever I come here, I feel Rama and Seetha follow me to home.
1:07:14
Who else is there for us other than them? Come with me, I will get the invitation kept at lord is feet.
1:07:28
Jasmine twig in the courtyard of Seethamma... It is blooming with flowers...
1:07:36
Pluck the flowers without disturbing the branch... Deck Seethamma is tresses with jasmine...
1:07:44
Flowers in the tresses are spreading fragrance... Kodanda Ramayya is coming...
1:08:07
Marriage band is ranting the sky... Hear the rhythm and beat of music...
1:08:14
Lord Sri Hari is marrying Goddess Siri... Come to wish and bless them...
1:08:22
To give right meaning of Telugu marriage rituals... To show it in action and spirit...
1:08:29
We will celebrate amidst thundering ovation from the guests... You are a beautiful doll... Your man is here to tie the knot...
1:08:40
To become a partner of life... Accept his hand, O lady...
1:09:23
No use to say we have seen many such things... You do not know the weight till you carry it...
1:09:30
Though putting up a brave face... there is a bit of nervousness inside... It is natural for you to be burdened with beauty and shyness...
1:09:41
At last time has burdened us with work... Though we are men, we carry on with smile...
1:09:48
We will feel proud leisurely after the victory flag is hoisted...
1:11:13
If it was Vijayawada, I would not do it, workers would do it. Where is the elder one? Are you here? Come here!
1:11:22
Guests would not bother about feast, they would bother about how we welcomed and inquired about them.
1:11:28
You must stand at entrance and welcome everyone personally. Me? - Has Vijayawada family arrived? On the way, boys are bringing them personally.
1:11:34
Guests would come there also, you too must say hello to them. You both must look after the guests.
1:11:40
Brother! Look who is here? How are you doing? - Fine. He was here but shifted to Hyderabad and made good money.
1:11:48
Very good man. My elder son and younger son. What do you do?
1:11:54
He was in Vizag, he quit the job. Come to Hyderabad, I have lot of friends.
1:11:59
I can get you a job in minutes. Your father knows very well about me. Send him sir, he must remain jobless.
1:12:05
Send him, we are there for you. - I will send him, come in. Please take him. - Come. You come, you be on the job.
1:12:12
You are younger son, where are you? Where in Hyderabad? Where ever I feel like, please come.
1:12:18
Smart boy!
1:12:23
Are you the elder son? What are you doing? Please! What are you doing now? I saw you as a little boy.
1:12:33
Are you fine, boy? What are you doing? What bothers you, uncle? You are asking for formality.
1:12:39
You came to attend marriage, right? Have dinner and go. Serve him well, he looks very weak.
1:12:44
Everyone asks the same question. Everyone asks, what do you do?
1:12:54
Go, go and have dinner.
1:13:15
Why is he doing the duty which he hates? His father taught him to smile not how to live!
1:13:26
Cannot see him here? - You came and added sheen! If you do not come, since you came it will add sheen.
1:13:33
Why have you grown thin? Did you not eat the sweets I brought? Please come.
1:13:53
Are you fine, younger one? You have proved Relangi people is reputation. Arranged it well. Everyone has his own thing! Please come.
1:14:03
We cannot do it, brother! Your brother is managing it very well. Where are the keys? - How do I know?
1:14:11
Are you doing well, Seetha? It is been years since I have seen you.
1:14:21
I will be back in a minute. Hey younger one, call aunt!
1:14:31
Why are you going away without talking to us? That is... Will you marry my niece?
1:14:37
Should he marry your niece? Cannot he marry my daughter? Anyone would be ready to give their daughter to him in marriage.
1:14:43
Stay put here, I will come back in a minute. They are like pumpkins, how would their daughters be?
1:14:49
Marry off every girl here to him! Younger one!
1:14:56
Younger one!
1:15:03
You are acting too proud! Arrogance of being handsome!
1:15:10
Who is he? Someone, I am sure he will be there somewhere. He too like me when a girl is madly in love with him,
1:15:17
He is always tensed about someone watching them. Shall we also marry in a coconut farm like this?
1:15:23
If it rains we can marry getting wet. Did you hear everything? Please go!
1:15:30
Wait for few minutes, I will come back. She is too smart, Cannot get rid of her easily. Are you eating or serving? - Both! - Go!
1:15:58
What is your idea about Seetha? Looks like they are planning to marry her off to elder one.
1:16:04
Planning? It is fixed that Seetha would become wife of elder one. What do you say? They call it something...what is that?
1:16:11
Cannot get it right? - Sweet kajjikaya? You keep quiet. - Silly! Cannot get the right word at right time!
1:16:16
Qualification! One must have it. Are you saying he has or not?
1:16:25
Water please! - Get water quickly. Elder one, get water immediately! Water please!
1:16:33
Give him!
1:16:42
Cannot you bring it full? Always does everything half! Never do anything with half knowledge.
1:16:50
No use in arranging marriage in coconut farm, You have to take care of guests well, right? Are you serving only half in dinner too?
1:16:57
When will you change? If possible eat what we serve and bless the couple.
1:17:04
Do not say anything with an ulterior motive. Half knowledge? You be firm on one thing!
1:17:12
Why did you tell him like that? His bad luck is that I am trying to tell you do not know,
1:17:21
and he cannot accept the fact that he does not know anything, and you are asking about Seetha is marriage with him,
1:17:28
and I am hearing that patiently. Did I tell I would marry Seetha?
1:17:33
Tell me, did I? - Elder one calm down! It is normal in marriages. If you marry Seetha,
1:17:38
Whether you agree or not, he must wash your feet! Why are you refusing to marry Seetha?
1:17:43
We all think you would marry Seetha. Come...come... - What is it then, uncle?
1:17:48
Every time he chides saying we do not know anything. What does he know about us? Did he help us?
1:17:54
If he talks bad about us, I will break his teeth! Without my daughters help, could not get a decent proposal till now.
1:18:02
In fact you must wash my feet... ...and sprinkle that water on your head all your life.
1:18:08
What is he talking about? What is it all about?
1:18:20
Brother, told me to remind you at the auspicious time. What is that? Everyone belittles me!
1:18:31
Hey younger one, come here. Where is the elder one?
1:18:38
I think he is on some job. Tell him to do it later, ask him to come and bless her.
1:18:57
What are you doing here? People are waiting there for you. Come.
1:19:07
What happened to him? Why are you off the mood now? Come. How should I be? - How should you be?
1:19:14
How? - I meant how should I be?
1:19:23
Are you angry because they have fixed the marriage against your wish? Who you are angry on? Mother? Father? Or me?
1:19:31
Who would keep quiet If I show my anger anyone? What is it then? Never again in life we must talk or enter the house of Vijayawada family.
1:19:39
Relationship between us is snapped permanently. Did they say anything? I will ask them. Bloody!
1:19:45
Everyone has their own pride! What did they say? Everyone will ask it. Attended...their marriages... housewarming ceremony,
1:19:53
and fixed marriage too!
1:20:00
Whose marriage is this? Is it not our sisters marriage? Not some strangers, right? Do I not know that? Can I not think about that?
1:20:07
I cannot bow my head to every Tom, Dick and Harry. I will be like this, I will be like what I am. That is what I am telling you,
1:20:13
you cannot be like that! This is life! Cannot be adamant like that! If it is not possible, I will go away.
1:20:19
Go away, everyone talks about life, I will go away. Cannot watch you go away, can I? We will not let you go!
1:20:25
Says he will go away! If God lets us live for long, we will be together all our lives!
1:20:33
What are you both doing here? Aunt is calling you!
1:20:40
Aunt is calling you!
1:20:45
Okay, come quickly!
1:20:58
Okay, do not take to your heart, come. You go. - Please come. You go! That is the problem with you.
1:21:04
How can you be like this always? We can have many fights? Can we look cheap to others? Please come. I cannot act like you, go! Play your drama there!
1:21:46
Please arrange it. You count the chairs. That too!
1:22:04
I have paid to musicians. Promised to settle Pandu by evening.
1:22:15
Where were you, Khader bhai? Your missing was promiscuous in marriage.
1:22:22
There is no better friend to me than you, brother. I went on a visit to Mecca without informing you. I did not even go to home, because the home I go after Mecca visit would be happy!
1:22:30
Very happy to hear that. Where is sister-in-law? - She is inside. Are you fine? - Have breakfast.
1:22:36
Marriage went off well, right? - Super, father. No shortcomings, right?
1:22:42
People are saying you did very well. It seems your sister is in-laws have a custom,
1:22:48
they have a vow to fulfill in Chinna Tirupathi. Your mother and I have to attend a function, you both go with them. If you both go, it would look good!
1:22:56
You will go, right? Where is he? He is inside. - Should I tell him? No need, I will tell him. - Okay, go.
1:24:05
We are very lucky! We could not get this proposal even if we had tried. I am saying thanks on behalf of everyone here.
1:24:10
I think this is also a character bestowed to you by your father. How is it possible for your father to say only good things?
1:24:17
Forget it, you both brothers were the main attraction in the marriage. Both managed it well. Stay together like this always! Like Rama and Lakshmana!
1:24:24
Hubby! - Coming!
1:25:02
Hello...
1:25:09
I can hear you, tell me. You... - I...?
1:25:17
You... Why did you kick the flower pot?
1:25:27
Why did you kick the flower pot?
1:25:36
Where are you? Where are you?
1:25:43
Cut it, I am coming!
1:26:14
Did you eat? - No, I am famished! Go eat!
1:26:38
Enough... - Eat well, do not know what you eat there. I am always worried. Have little. - Enough!
1:26:45
Eat well son, do not know when would you come again? Why are you eating like that? If you are free, pack my bag.
1:26:54
Do not pack everything. - Enough, mother! He returned that day, it is useless to carry luggage.
1:27:04
Find a job at least this time, how long can you carry on like this?
1:27:13
Please take elder one along with you. What would he do here?
1:27:18
Other than picking up trouble! It seems a man in marriage promised to find a job for him.
1:27:28
You tell him and take him with you.
1:27:37
Seetha, elder one is here, serve him food.
1:27:43
Have some more, son. - Finished. Have buttermilk! You keep listening to empty talk, getting late to the train.
1:27:52
I am not going, you carry on. Do I not know what to do?
1:28:00
Look after him!
1:28:10
Four weeks does not mean four weeks. One must not remember about weeks and months in honeymoon. Well said sister.
1:28:18
I feel strange when I hear such dialogues. If he did not have a job, how long he would have taken to flatter her?
1:28:26
Come there, bro! We can settle in one go! Think about what mother said! Okay, do you have money? - I have.
1:28:32
Do you? Keep it. - I have.
1:28:41
Go!
1:28:47
It is crowded! No place to sit also. Call me after reaching there. - Okay, I will call.
1:28:52
Think over it again. - What? What mother said! - I will think. Do not think, come!
1:28:58
Do you want me to come now? - Now? Want me to come?
1:29:04
You are great! Come!
1:29:14
This is the worst find of the century!
1:29:22
Your brother is great, always simple and no fuss. Personality too is quite strong!
1:29:27
What does he lack? Lost a shade working hard for marriage. Hyderabad would bring back...
1:29:32
Always worried about growing thin, complexion! Forget about all this, half of country is problems will be solved.
1:29:41
Move! He always calls me dark. Watch, I will fix him now.
1:29:50
Younger one, give me a cigarette. Give me, I am asking you. I am nervous!
1:30:00
In Vijayawada we break cigarette into two, throw it and say catch it!
1:30:07
Why so many dramas to make a living? Nobody is happy or nobody is free!
1:30:16
Younger one! Younger one! No signal!
1:30:23
Younger one! What happened dear? Why are you tensed?
1:30:34
Necklace road is very nice. It inquired about you, It asked me to come again today also. Will you please come?
1:30:43
Are you in Hyderabad? - Found that now? I am angry with sullen face! I am hurt!
1:30:53
When I said I am coming to Hyderabad, you cut my call. Cut it, I will call you later.
1:31:04
Who is it? Relatives...I have relatives all over the place!
1:31:11
Eat everything yourself, do not give him anything. He is doing too much! What brings you to Hyderabad suddenly?
1:31:18
Sister is coming from America, came to receive her. Entire family is here. Did not tell about my brother-in-law, did I?
1:31:26
You saw him in marriage, right? He is cute, right? - Can he do somersaults?
1:31:32
If I praise any other man, you become very tall! Look, how red your nose has turned!
1:31:37
Basically boys are very good! Air...magic of air!
1:31:43
One must use the given freedom. One must know what to give and what to take!
1:31:49
Just a minute! Devadas, Majnu and Romeo their love stories created history.
1:32:01
The left after creating a trend. Different from all of them! Is it so lucky to be born as a girl?
1:32:07
Would it be so good to be born as a girl? I will definitely make you feel that! Hugs and kisses are bonuses.
1:32:14
Come, hug me! Hug me!
1:32:21
Do not worry about people watching us. You carry on!
1:32:26
What next? Tell me. - You tell me. Then?
1:32:33
Tell me. Do not ask now, I am sure to tell only lies.
1:32:41
O boy! A girl is waiting for you, find her...
1:32:51
I have come searching you among so many...
1:33:00
You were searching and I was waiting to be found and become your partner...
1:33:09
I have much to tell...so much to tell... you tell me now...tell me...
1:33:51
Why do they say I was born for you?
1:33:56
Should I have to wait for 20 long years to meet you? What do we give to make you love us so much?
1:34:11
Years have to pass to become like this... Do not get so tensed, we would like you anyway...
1:34:18
I can realize it...
1:35:03
How happy you are when we ask you to go away... When you walk away, we follow you like your shadow...
1:35:12
You go blank when we come before you...that is true... There is no reason to get angry...
1:35:22
Boys are a mix of good and stubbornness... You have come down for us... - Do not say like that...
1:36:12
Do not worry, I am coming. - Move please.
1:36:20
That is it, check, brother-in-law. It went down, brother-in-law. It will raise again by 3 pm, I am in this field for 30 years.
1:36:25
Do it. - Doing it sir. What? Someone from your place is here for you. It seems you promised to find a job for him.
1:36:31
Is he here? I know him very well, tell him to wait for 2 minutes, I will come. Go for that.
1:36:38
Sir told you to wait for 10 minutes. - Okay.
1:37:06
Open Ranbaxy. Sir, he is waiting for an hour now. Can I call him in?
1:37:12
I know him very well, please tell him to wait. Open both!
1:37:34
What is the time now? - 2 pm! When I was eating my favorite dish, I remembered elder one.
1:37:42
Do not know what is he doing? He will eat on time wherever he may be.
1:37:49
If not he will get angry instantly.
1:37:54
Stopped eating rice to stop the growing girth. Why eat this? That will end all your trouble.
1:37:59
Have you done it? Be on job. Open Ranbaxy.
1:38:13
You are great, brother-in-law. Sir, he is waiting since morning. It is 5 pm now. Great! I know him very well, tell him to wait, go.
1:38:28
Who is the man who promised to find a job for me? Who is he? Is it not you?
1:38:34
Why do make empty promises back in your native lace? Cannot you be happy with yourself? Did I ask your help?
1:38:39
Friends, bloody friends! First learn to see humans as humans.
1:39:09
Life is very strange! We will go as far as it throws us!
1:39:14
Did not get the job! Do not have hope of getting one. Looking at the crowd and noise...
1:39:20
It is not like our place. I feel like going home. - If not this try another.
1:39:25
Try another? Looking at those men makes me furious.
1:39:32
I do not get it. Not seen outside but inside is eating me away.
1:39:52
As kids you went to school, I followed you.
1:39:57
You did not go to school till I came with you. I went with you.
1:40:02
After few years, Alivelu, Srivadh, Dhanalakshmi, - Krishnakumari!
1:40:08
That is it, I was afraid you would tell our parents. I used to make my own plans. Narendra theatre...Padmasri theatre!
1:40:16
Cinema, mother, father, how many feelings! Why did you remember all that now?
1:40:22
You said you did not get it. Is this not enough? We have to see a lot in future. We both would get married, they would fight for little things,
1:40:33
few children would come up, mummy, daddy, homework and so many things, we must be just like as we are now! Remember that!
1:40:40
You are ready to cook up tales!
1:40:46
Are you fine, son? Where is the elder one?
1:40:53
What happened to his job? Ask him yourself. Who? - Mother, talk to her.
1:40:58
You talk to her. - Just a sec, he will talk to you. Trapped me!
1:41:06
Did you eat, son?
1:41:11
Eat on time, son. You love the sweets I make, shall I send it?
1:41:20
He will never change. - What did you say now?
1:41:32
It seems they have a swimming pool too, If we get a job here, we can work sleeping. Work sleeping? You fool!
1:41:40
Who is she with pillars under the feet?
1:41:46
Buddy!
1:41:53
You do not eat cool food, right? Your face is a face to watch again and again.
1:42:00
Mine! Could not even wait for a year? Is he doing job or selling goggles?
1:42:07
You asked where I would keep If you give a flower? He is allergic to flowers. I found such a man.
1:42:16
Go and eat before it cools down. Girls I chased or girls who chased me,
1:42:24
when they get caught with such guys, It is a jig inside! Folk dance!
1:42:30
Come in, call for us.
1:42:36
Did you hear this? Raghava Rao is daughter-in-law has brought even brush from her parents home.
1:42:42
She is not letting husband also to touch it. There are such people too. Shut up! Always carrying messages.
1:42:49
You bring all messages, do you not have any work? Be careful with her. Keep quiet madam, just messages of good and bad.
1:42:56
Add some more ghee, it will be tasty. You wait, show all your hurry in elder one is marriage.
1:43:03
Aunt, tell me a thing. If I marry your elder son, would you be mother, as you raised me like a mother,
1:43:09
or would you become a mother-in-law to me suddenly? Will you ask anything you feel? Will you not keep anything inside?
1:43:14
If I hide things I will put on weight.
1:43:22
Great service! Not much eating but long waiting.
1:43:30
He will build another hotel with our bill. So, eat without any compromise.
1:43:37
Has the water not cooled yet? Why are you talking like villagers? Change the slang. Are we not?
1:43:47
Come her girls! What are you doing there? Coming! Why did you not tell me till now?
1:43:53
I thought of telling after I am clear about it. Now I am clear and I find it very nice.
1:43:59
He is Relangi uncle is son, so he is handsome. But how are you going to manage it?
1:44:05
Do one thing, call me, I will do the talking. I have already called him. - Is it? When?
1:44:12
Right now! Did not tell him all are here. To become number one son-in-law he must get the shock, right?
1:44:25
If my brother asks, do not tell him anything. What will he ask? What he does not want to tell?
1:44:32
Hyderabad is confusing!
1:44:37
Once please! Once more please! - Once more later, come here.
1:44:42
Where is your sister? Show me.
1:44:51
Entire gang is here! Fixed me perfectly.
1:44:57
Look who is here! Where did you see him? - Hey younger one!
1:45:04
Are you parents doing fine? Come! Entire family is here, come. Sister!
1:45:17
Come. He is my nephew, Relangi brothers son.
1:45:23
Is it? I saw you as a kid. You have dropped in suddenly. Not suddenly, sister invited him.
1:45:31
She invited him, right?
1:45:41
You get up, you sit there. Please sit here. - Sit
1:46:05
Eat!
1:46:15
Stop smiling please!
1:46:27
What are you doing?
1:46:32
Are you doing something or unemployed?
1:46:39
Look, a planning, great care and a vision!
1:46:47
Look at them! Going to office at 9 am and coming back home at 5 pm,
1:46:56
applying powder all over the neck, unable to decide which channel to watch on TV,
1:47:02
If wife is cooking in kitchen, going astray looking here and there, I hate that life. Do you all in your home talk like this?
1:47:11
I think nobody talks straight. I found all the rules of making money in this world,
1:47:20
I still cannot understand you or your principles. If there is any peeve in my life, this is it.
1:47:30
Behavior! His brother! You would have seen in marriage, he created a big scene.
1:47:38
Just for a glass of water. A big fuss! Please take him to a doctor.
1:47:43
Please do not leave him. Advise him! Why did you leave him? If I knew you were responsible for his mood off that day,
1:47:51
I do not know what would have had happened. Would I keep quiet till it happens? All I ask is to change your attitude, If you say we will not,
1:47:58
who is the loser? My father too did not advise us to live like this or like that. Why would I hear advice from a foolish stranger?
1:48:05
Though smart I will never listen to over smart guys like you. Look, I will come down till you come down.
1:48:12
Remember that! Never again overstep into my family matters. I will bash you black and blue!
1:48:35
I expected so much, why did you ruin it? I planned so much to highlight you before my dad.
1:48:40
To hell with your father, do you want to highlight me before him?
1:48:45
You do not appear but very angry man! But you are handsome even while angry.
1:48:51
Had you worn more colorful shirt, you would be rocking. You too see only outside things like your dad not anything inside.
1:48:57
What did he teach you? Do fathers teach everything? We have our own sources. Why are you shouting?
1:49:03
Do fathers teach everything? - Shut up... What?
1:49:10
One slap and all your teeth would roll out. I am hurt. I am feeling bad with sullen face.
1:49:19
Look at me! Look at her play act!
1:49:24
No doubt, your dad has spoilt you. Why a dad before and after every word?
1:49:31
Talk as usually you do, funnily! You do not worry about people is condition, you must be given what you ask.
1:49:40
I will jump! - Jump, good riddance! I will jump from here.
1:49:46
I am jumping down!
1:50:34
This is not love at all, nobody can say this is love. Love means lot of sweet talk, pet names, talk over phone,
1:50:47
She is another big trouble along with him.
1:51:00
Why did you call me now? - What is the time now? 11 pm! - So what?
1:51:05
Night...dark...I am afraid of darkness, cut it. One second, I did not call, my phone insisted on calling.
1:51:13
The situation I am in and she is talking funny!
1:51:19
Where is he? Where is Geetha?
1:51:27
Where are you? I am waiting here for you. Come, I am on terrace. I am leaving. - Where?
1:51:34
Going back to home. - Why? Please listen...
1:51:54
Everyone is happy as they want to be except me! Cannot he ask? Will I not answer him? With a long face...
1:52:02
Just one such man is enough to understand life.
1:52:08
I will lose Rs.7000!
1:52:14
Elder on has come back, Do not know what has happened there? Did you ask him? Why? Did the younger one not call?
1:52:21
When I ask about elder one you say ask younger one or vice versa. They will take care of each other themselves.
1:52:28
I too wish it, By Gods grace Chinni is marriage went off peacefully.
1:52:33
Bezawada brings to my memory... I am thinking of going to their home.
1:52:41
It seems elder daughter has come from America. Can we ever forget the favor she did to us?
1:52:46
I will go and tell we wish to hear good news in near future.
1:52:53
Prepare sweets. I will take them with me.
1:53:01
Looks like it may rain, get the clothes, Seetha. I will get it.
1:53:36
What is this? Somebody is taking photos from up there! I am getting ready to give pose. Bloody photos.
1:53:42
Wait, let us take a snap together. Look there! - What?
1:53:47
Look there! - What? Just see once!
1:53:54
Look there!
1:54:04
How can I stop myself if rain drops wet me like this?
1:54:10
How can my youth resist the lashes of rain?
1:54:16
Hold on dear, why are you rushing? Am I so cheap to you?
1:54:22
I am here to take to the world of bliss...
1:54:52
I got wet because of you... I danced in rain because of you...
1:54:59
You know why? You would allow me to come closer...
1:55:05
I have made my sari end as your umbrella... I am warming you with my breath...
1:55:12
I would give certainly whatever I have to you...
1:56:06
I shone with shyness... I called you with my heart beat...
1:56:12
Rained like kisses on you... Become a rainbow on your horizon...
1:56:19
Your first call of youth is making my heart to sprout love...
1:56:26
When you pour down on me, there is no end to the happiness...
1:57:16
Very good proposal. Groom is very handsome. They know everything so would not mind such trivial things.
1:57:26
It is not an ordinary proposal, to whom I am telling this, who should get this message directly, the message must reach them,
1:57:32
and stop breaking into mad jigs, the faster they get out from those thoughts the better for all of us.
1:57:39
Wait! Where are you going? If you see a boy, you must judge his capacity.
1:57:48
If not why to study so much and have health drinks.
1:57:54
Say anything or get any great proposal, I will not agree for the marriage till you fix Seethas marriage first.
1:58:04
Just one girl! Never took care of her! You must arrange her marriage, If not consider me as dead.
1:58:12
Calm down, brother will talk, do not get tensed, mother. What will he talk? You keep talking all the life.
1:58:21
Did you ever let me talk? I love him more than you two!
1:58:29
He is dead anyway! Did you ever bother about him? All are here, did they bother about her?
1:58:36
Tell me, did they bother about her? Hello brother-in-law!
1:58:44
Brother! - Are you all doing fine? Your aunt made these sweets for you.
1:58:51
She wished you to have children like her sweets.
1:58:56
Are you fine, dear? - Fine. Is everyone fine? - I forgot about you. Are you fine? Is your health fine?
1:59:02
How are you dear? - Please sit down, brother. Are you fine, dear? - Fine, brother. I am very happy to see you all at one place!
1:59:12
When did you come, Kondal Rao? You are very lucky, you said and he is here.
1:59:17
Nothing brother, they were talking about Seetha is marriage. Younger daughter is got a good proposal, Old woman wants Seetha to be married first and you walked in, brother.
1:59:29
We have the responsibility of Seetha as much as you have. Moreover it is marriage. We must think over it deeply.
1:59:38
You may have ideas of fixing her marriage with your elder son. What do you say that...
1:59:44
Unqualified! You too do not wish to marry her off to an unemployed man, right?
1:59:51
You too would bother about what people will say! Look at Kondal Rao!
1:59:57
If we fix Seetha is marriage with his son. Would he jump in joy?
2:00:03
He would say immediately, for idiotic son? I will fix Seetha is marriage finding a good proposal.
2:00:13
Anyone would think of only good for Seetha. You do not get any other thought. Because she is Seetha!
2:00:20
Good!
2:00:26
How is the sari, aunt? Why are you asking me? - Why?
2:00:32
Are you going to stay with us? We clamor as our relatives... Look how she has turned up for bride seeing ceremony.
2:00:40
Uncle asked me and I am doing it that is all. Your uncle will say! He went to see them and brought a marriage proposal.
2:00:51
Uncle! No use in discussing now If my elder son had been normal?
2:01:08
Do not know in which situation uncle had to promise them.
2:01:14
Should we not honor uncle is word?
2:01:20
We are open family. We openly discuss everything openly. But my son is little old type for girls,
2:01:28
he does not like them to run or talk loudly! What are you saying daddy? I am more open than you. In fact you put so many restrictions to mom.
2:01:34
Is it not mom? Tell him. - No, I am totally open. Vijayawada man has sent a great proposal.
2:01:40
We praise ourselves too much, they are worse than us. What are you waiting for? Call Seetha.
2:01:47
Seetha, come.
2:02:45
Who is he? His elder son, Seetha is loves him.
2:02:50
If you refuse he will marry her. You are open type, so I told you everything openly.
2:02:58
Mother, fix it quickly. It is okay from our side.
2:03:04
No need of formalities like engagement. Get two upper cloths, cover me and my son with it.
2:03:09
We can fix the marriage in a week.
2:03:15
He must not call me! He must not call me!
2:03:23
He must not call me!
2:03:49
What is that? Give it.
2:04:16
What? It seems he is very handsome! It seems he will take good care of me.
2:04:22
Look, if he has one quality better than me, marry him. Not just the fool your father shows, let it be anyone.
2:04:29
Marry him! Cut it!
2:04:45
I too would find a girl. With a cheek which would turn pink for 30 days for just one kiss. Cut it.
2:05:09
My foot! I thought the world is so beautiful because of boys and girls.
2:05:16
My foot! It is difficult for a girl to be as she wants in every situation.
2:05:21
They make big buildup of reforming us and our mistakes all through our life! Must be brave, must have sense of humor!
2:05:27
I will like only if you have those qualities. It is humbug! Do you know when they need bravery? To take them on bike without meeting an accident.
2:05:35
What is that nasty look, you fool?
2:06:04
Hey boy!
2:06:45
How is he, mother? Keep checking his BP regularly.
2:06:55
You did a good thing by bringing him here on time. Nothing will happen to him. I told you nothing will happen to him. He will be fine.
2:07:01
He will be fine! If he is not fine, since you all wish him good, he will be fine!
2:07:08
Greetings!
2:08:34
Hey younger one! Which ward your father is in? Come!
2:08:40
Greetings! - Greetings. Are you fine? You got well quickly, very tough man.
2:08:47
Greetings. Are you also here, Kondal Rao?
2:08:54
My respect for you has increase for seeing you with him.
2:09:00
Vijayawada man used to say you do not know how to make a living! I too used to join him.
2:09:07
Life is greater than making a living. Risking one is life to save another life is much greater!
2:09:15
You have proved it by example. The boy you saved is none other than my brothers son.
2:09:23
They wanted to come, I insisted I will meet them first.
2:09:28
I cannot cry artificially. I cannot do any other thing
2:09:36
Than bowing in honor for you!
2:09:44
What are you doing, younger one? You look smarter than your brother.
2:09:50
Why are you delaying? You must catch up with life quickly. How good it would be if you settle down in life for your fathers position!
2:09:58
I did not say anything to your elder son too. Just a chide and he left angrily.
2:10:03
Let bygones be bygones. Send him to me. I will take care of him.
2:10:14
Mother! - I am here son! Mother, I am leaving to Hyderabad tomorrow evening.
2:10:22
Why do not you stay for few more days? I will stay but what will I do here? I must find something there, right?
2:10:28
Tell the same thing to elder one too! Pack him off, son! He has invited him to Vizag. It will not be nice.
2:10:37
How long this anger would last? Do not just look after yourself, tell him strictly and pack him off.
2:10:43
Why do you not tell him that? You will not!
2:10:48
I have been seeing since childhood, you tell me everything. Nobody will dare ask him!
2:10:54
If you or father had asked him why is he loitering aimlessly?
2:10:59
He would have settled by now! But you will not ask him! You hesitate, fear and feel embarrassed!
2:11:05
You put the burden on me. I am unable to answer the world outside. You want me to send him!
2:11:11
Why are you talking like this? My elder son is like that, he is not that smart!
2:11:17
He cannot get along with people like you. He cannot and I too! That is why I asked you!
2:11:23
You make big statements of doing big things, right?
2:11:28
Fight the world... would you get food without fighting?
2:11:33
Unable to show my face outside. Everyone asks what are they doing?
2:11:39
Are you kids? If I ask anything you get angry!
2:12:35
What do you want me to do? I do not feel like going.
2:12:42
How can I go there? I left them once! They may have changed but what about me?
2:12:50
The same fuss, the same people! Do not we know what to do?
2:12:55
You always say we must hit the jackpot. You are right.
2:13:02
I still believe that. There is a limit for everything, there is!
2:13:07
We will never remain like this forever. Never!
2:13:17
Do you feel that I must go back there?
2:13:23
Tell me if you feel like that. Tell me, what should I do now?
2:13:30
You were born before me, do not you know what to do and what not to do.
2:13:36
There is a limit... there is a limit for everything. For living, for relationship and for patience too!
2:13:43
There must be limit! When asked say do I not know! If they know cannot they ask!
2:13:50
Give advice about good and bad all the day! Moreover sentiments too!
2:13:55
Either you or I will feel bad If they ask anything. If this situation continues, We will not have the courage to die also!
2:14:25
Are there no clouds and lightning the beacons of rain?
2:14:33
Little tiffs and anger are other side of affection...
2:14:42
Has silence refused to hear the laughter of happiness?
2:14:50
Has relationships refused to join in the bond of affection?
2:14:59
Though it is bitter, we have it happily calling it as Ugadi...
2:15:07
If difficulties are relatives on short visit...
2:15:12
We will always be happy...
2:15:36
What sir? Your smile is little... No, I am smiling normally.
2:15:48
I am smiling from heart. Look, 200 employees would be working under you.
2:15:54
You have to lead them with your smile.
2:16:19
I told you he does not have it in him.
2:16:31
Smile If you feel like or cry if you feel like. I cannot smile as you want for your money!
2:16:36
To hell with your job! My foot!
2:16:42
It is hard If you think so or easy if you think so... Decide how your life should be...
2:16:50
You will not get whatever you want... there is a shortfall always... So dream the better life...
2:16:59
Summer is for mangoes... rainy season is for rainbows...
2:17:07
Fire to warm winters... Smile for difficulties...
2:18:00
Shall we go to Bhadrachalam, uncle? Anything special? I made a vow for family visit If you get well soon.
2:18:08
I made a vow! Keep quiet, we can visit later when everything is fine. Everything will be fine If we visit now.
2:18:15
As if you know everything. Do not know, I know everything just like that! Uncle, let us go!
2:18:23
What do you say? If you want to go, okay to me also.
2:18:29
Then, I will tell grandma. Come here!
2:18:36
Sit here! Shall we go? Will it be fine? - Very fine!
2:18:43
Okay!
2:19:00
Come here! Sit here!
2:19:08
Elder one! Come with younger one!
2:19:31
While going we must take pearls of Rama, tell him also.
2:19:41
Look, what a glimpse!
2:19:54
Hello brother-in-law! Are you fine? Uncle!
2:19:59
Vijayawada family! Greetings sir. - Greetings.
2:20:05
Seetha too is here.
2:20:23
Hail Lord Rama!
2:20:37
Come here! No problem, come here.
2:20:46
Inspector, come here. Bring the elderly man sitting there.
2:21:10
Greetings sir. - Are you fine? Come and carry this! Come I say!
2:21:17
People do not get this opportunity easily.
2:21:24
Okay? Hail Lord Rama!
2:21:33
This opportunity is given by Lord Rama not me.
2:21:48
Hail Lord Rama!
2:22:11
Take your vehicle away! - Okay sir. Take it away!
2:22:57
Mother!
2:23:55
If anyone breaks down the transformer, electrification would stop. If you touch, you will get electrocuted!
2:24:00
We would die anyway If we stay here!
2:24:14
Elder one!
2:25:04
Send it immediately! Hail Lord Rama!
2:25:11
No more to fear! Do not run, please sit down!
2:25:54
Move little, son.
2:26:06
How people got scared in a minute! In 15 minutes, everything went haywire!
2:26:13
But you went bravely and saved people. Be like that!
2:26:19
That is enough! Everything else comes after that! Look there!
2:26:25
There are cowards, brave men, rich, doctors, peon,
2:26:31
everyone makes only one prayer, I am a good man, please save me.
2:26:39
You may think it is drama, it is not!
2:26:44
Generally people are good! Humans mean good!
2:26:53
What did I give you? Did I give you property? I gave you wings to fend for yourself!
2:27:00
As a common man, what can we give back to this society? Except a love filled family!
2:27:06
Is there anything better than that? He is your elder brother for this life only!
2:27:15
He is your younger brother for this life only. I am your father for this life only!
2:27:21
Forget about life, we cannot be sure of crossing this road also. That is why smile at every person you meet and carry on.
2:27:30
There is nothing to pray to God for ourselves. If you still wish to ask, pray for your neighbor.
2:27:40
God! Any man who leads his life honestly, Never take him away from smile!
2:27:55
That is all!
2:28:01
Come, let us go.
2:29:00
That is... Whatever it is say it on my face!
2:29:16
I am intoxicated by men. That is why I blabbered as I wished!
2:29:23
Likewise I would have done with you also. Do not take it seriously. No, I used to tell me something new!
2:29:33
But when you said you were born before me, do you not know that? I felt it was something really new!
2:29:42
Who else is there for me other than you!
2:29:50
You were younger to me, I thought I could tell everything to you.
2:29:58
But I did not know my words would test you so much!
2:30:04
You could have told me that day itself.
2:30:10
Just one thing! Once born, we must live great!
2:30:16
Must have a good life and be good to everyone. That is all! When I did not see it in you, I used to get angry.
2:30:24
Unable to tell you directly, I said something indirectly.
2:30:29
Not because you are elder to me. You are a good man! Much better man than me.
2:30:35
Not just me, you are better than all here.
2:30:45
You were right, I play drama. I played many a drama.
2:30:52
With you...with a girl... with everyone! Shut up!
2:30:58
You know at least something, I do not know that too. I did not know how to behave...
2:31:05
...and was adamant on behaving like this only. With that one line, I played more drama than you.
2:31:14
Father was right, you are my brother for this life only.
2:31:20
I am your younger brother for this life. Is it for this life only?
2:31:26
That is the problem with you! River Godavari turned red at dawn...
2:31:32
The hue is competing with henna...
2:31:44
The hand with hue is blushing red... The blushing belle is draped in sari...
2:31:52
Who is the moon in sari? She is none other than beautiful Seethamma...
2:32:01
You wanted to leave everyone and go away, right? I know everything from the beginning. I know what had happened between you both.
2:32:07
Not just me, but even uncle knows it. I told him everything. How do you know it? Do not know, I know everything just like that!
2:32:15
What did I deny you? Like other husbands when their wives get headache, you cannot apply balm or say sweet words!
2:32:25
You do not have to look after me even If I get fever. No need to take me to a film too in life!
2:32:36
Jasmine twig in the courtyard of Seethamma... It is blooming with flowers...
2:32:44
Pluck the flowers without disturbing the branch... Deck Seethamma is tresses with jasmine...
2:32:52
Flowers in the tresses are spreading fragrance... Kodanda Ramayya is coming...
2:33:00
Here comes Ramayya... Spread his magical charm on his arrival...
2:33:17
This is the place Seetha becomes consort of Rama...
2:33:25
It is the time earth and sky become kinsmen...
2:33:32
Three knots will make the three worlds to celebrate...
2:33:40
Seven steps together would make them a couple forever...
2:33:54
Jasmine twig in the courtyard of Seethamma... A parrot made home in it...
2:34:02
The parrot said a charming word... Hearing the word would make you say Oh God...
2:34:10
Seetha is heart chanted the name of Rama... What else? - You tell me. You tell me. - What else?
2:34:17
Did you find a man more handsome than me? Got him? You too said a girl,
2:34:23
whose cheeks would turn pink for 30 days for just one kiss. Did you find her? You are smarter than you appear.
2:34:30
You too, people say like that! Who is that? - That is I this time.
2:34:38
Will you not have lunch? I thought it easily but It is not an ordinary matter.
2:34:43
You are a great man. - You are too much. You gave two daughters for our progeny to continue. Who could be greater than you?
2:34:50
Brother, this is not ours but theirs!
2:34:59
Stop...stop... Tell your names and enter. First the girl! - Not girl but first boy!
2:35:08
What do you want me to tell? - Tell! I am here with her.
2:35:13
Her? Tell her name. I am here with Seetha and that is it. Okay fine, get in.
2:35:18
He said it, let us go in. - Wait, she must tell now. My uncle is name is...
2:35:25
My uncle is name is... My aunt is name is...
2:35:32
Their son is name is... I am Seetha, his wife I am here with my husband.
2:35:41
Next is your turn!
2:36:09
What else? - What else? There is a lot! - Okay. Tell me everything on phone after reaching there, do you have money?
2:36:14
I have. - Do you? I do have. - Keep it,
2:36:28
With a distinct single drop of character of humanity, United like the vastness of sea, meet and depart, depart to meet again,
2:36:35
Overcoming all the hurdles with a smile is the character of man, Families with such men, Towns with such families,
2:36:41
Countries with such towns are filled with love, This is our India, that showed the world that world is one big family!
